          <h2>Father Of The Natiom</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. Renowned as a leader of the Indian independence movement, Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance (Satyagraha) became a powerful tool against British colonial rule and a global symbol of peaceful activism.

              Educated in law in London, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893, where he faced racial discrimination that shaped his approach to social justice. In South Africa, he developed his nonviolent protest methods while advocating for Indian rights.
              
              Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi became a key figure in the struggle for independence. His strategies included large-scale non-cooperation with British authorities through boycotts of British goods, institutions, and taxes. The 1930 Salt March, a 240-mile protest against the British salt monopoly, stands out as a significant act of civil disobedience that mobilized the Indian population and drew international attention.
              
              
              Despite multiple imprisonments, Gandhi remained committed to nonviolence. His teachings influenced global leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, inspiring movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide.
              
              
              Mahatma Gandhi's legacy endures as a beacon of nonviolent resistance and the quest for justice. His philosophy continues to inspire civil rights movements, underscoring his timeless influence on global struggles for human dignity.
